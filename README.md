- First, you have to set the Backend :

> Backend : [_https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard_](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard).

- clone or downlaod this repository of the backend on your computer.

- open the file with VSCode.

- Install the dependencies by using this command :

`yarn`

`yarn dev`

If it works you should see :
